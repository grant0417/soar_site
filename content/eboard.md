Javian was elected President of SOAR in April 2019. Since assuming the position, he has taken responsibility of overseeing major operations of the organization which includes handling SOAR’s operational budget, obtaining sponsorships and partnerships from industry partners, recruitment of new members, and maintaining relationships with other organizations to collaboratively work towards achieving and the mission of SOAR and USF. SOAR encompasses more than just engineers and this year Javian plans to expand out and engage more than just the College of Engineering and host outreach events through the Tampa Bay area. This year SOAR is diving straight into liquid engine development for the Base 11 Space Challenge and will acquire the necessary resources and workspaces to secure the longevity of project development and to let USF be the first university to send a liquid-propelled rocket into space!

Javian is a senior studying Mechanical Engineering and will graduate in December 2020. Javian has a passion for aerospace and rocketry and plans to work in the industry right after graduation. In the past Javian was the Mechanical engineering Lead for the 2017-2018 NASA Student Launch competition and the Chief of Engineering for the 2018-2019 school year.

Our Chief of Finance for the 2019-2020 season is Ian Sanders. As Chief of Finance, Ian seeks to expand SOAR’s fledgling sponsorship program in order to maximize the organization’s resources as SOAR ventures into the exciting and innovative but cost-intensive field of liquid-fueled rockets. He also plans to streamline the purchasing process by improving the custom software that SOAR uses to manage the purchasing flow, thus improving communication and decreasing wait times for new parts and materials. Ian is also responsible for developing and managing the annual budget for this fiscal year.

Ian is a senior Mechanical Engineering student with a minor in Entrepreneurship. He expects to graduate in the spring of 2020 before continuing to a career in rocketry and space systems. He currently works as software development and data analysis engineering intern at Chromalloy Castings. Previously, Ian served as Vice President and Chief of Operations on the executive board, and as NASA Student Launch Vehicle Team Lead in the 2018-19 NSL competition. His ultimate dream is to start his own company designing and building rockets to efficiently and inexpensively launch small payloads into orbit.
