 The Society of Aeronautics and Rocketry (SOAR) at USF promotes engineering education and academic performance in a social environment through participation in projects and competitions dedicated to rocketry and aerospace technologies. SOAR provides an opportunity of students from all majors and fields to enhance their knowledge in research, engineering, and other tangential skills pertinent to the aerospace industry as well as the operation of a large organization.

As an organization we seek to contribute to the development of new and innovative systems that further human deep space exploration efforts. We view ourselves as a professional research organization that produces data and innovations relevant to the aerospace industry. In the mindset of professional organization we adhere to strict timelines, budget restrictions, management, teamwork, and fostering collaborations between the academic, commercial and government space industries in mission technology design. And as is necessary for a professional organization to effectively operate, SOAR utilize the skills of members from a broad range of fields of study, from finance, to engineering, to graphic arts, and everything in between.

In past years, SOAR has competed in the NASA Space Grant Consortium Hybrid Rocket Competition and the NASA Student Launch Initiative, as well as build a two-stage rocket, Taurus I.

2020 projects include the Base 11 Space Challenge and the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition.
