Education is primary among our many goals at SOAR. Our guiding organization, the Tripoli Rocket Association, recognizes three levels of certification, each authorizing the rocketeer to launch ever more powerful rockets. To this end, we conduct Level I and Level II Certification courses to help members learn the basics of rocketry and build a strong base of knowledgeable members. We believe this endeavor is paramount to the success of our organization and to transmitting knowledge that might otherwise be lost as members graduate.

In just one year, we have nearly 20 Level I certified students and 2 Level II certified students. With the launch of our new Level II program that will supply rockets specifically for this initiative, we expect that number to increase dramatically.

To learn more about getting certified, join the **#tripoli-certs** program on Slack.
