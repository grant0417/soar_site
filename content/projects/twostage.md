SOAR built the second (upper) stage of its first ever two-stage rocket, and successfully launched it at LDRS 36. Multi-stage rockets are virtually unheard of in the collegiate setting, so this is a huge accomplishment for us.

This rocket, known as Taurus I, will stand over 24′ (7.3 m) tall when finished this year and could potentially reach a height of 50,000′.
