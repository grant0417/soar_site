SOAR is excited to announce its participation in the all-new Base 11 Space Challenge, an incredibly difficult competition in which collegiate teams across the country compete to design, build, and launch a single-stage liquid-fueled rocket to the Karman Line (330,000 ft or 100 kms). Nothing close to this feat has ever been accomplished by any amateur team in history, so we have the chance to contribute groundbreaking developments to the space industry and change the course of history. This challenge has replaced our High-Altitude and Liquid Propulsion initiatives as a combination of the two. SOAR is currently working on building the team for this incredible project, so please donâ€™t hesitate to [apply now](@/join-usf-soar.md)!
