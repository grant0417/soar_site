Asterion is SOAR's most ambitious rocket to date. This vehicle will
fly on the most powerful commercially available rocket
motor, the Contrail O6300 Hybrid, and will accelerate to Mach 1.7 in 4 seconds.

The payload will consist of advanced student-developed avionics hardware that will live-stream flight metrics to a ground station and fit inside the form-factor of a 2U Cubesat. The rocket also features a modular ballast system, machined bulkheads, and removable fins.
