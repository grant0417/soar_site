The NASA University Student Launch Initiative (NSL, or USLI) is an annual rocketry competition that takes place in Huntsville, Alabama. The competition challenges student groups not only to innovate in engineering, but also to share that passion for the STEM fields with younger students through educational outreach activities.

In the 2017 event, SOAR developed a rocket that could identify targets on the ground using a camera system and onboard computer, and then perform a controlled upright landing. The rocket launched Alabama on April 8th.

For general information on this competition, see the NASA Student Launch website.
